# CSINTSYMCO1

This program is an implementation of the Depth First Search Algorithm.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. For each node, add using the following format: graph.put("[node name]", Arrays.asList("[node name]", "[node name]"));
2. You can add multiple nodes to the list, which indicates an edge to these nodes.
3. If it is an end node with no further branches, you may leave "Arrays.asList()" blank.
4. Run the program (driver class)
